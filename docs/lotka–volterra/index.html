The **Lotka–Volterra** equations, also known as the predator–prey
equations, are a pair of first-order, non-linear, differential
equations frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological
systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other
as prey. The populations change through time according to the pair of
equations:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha x - \beta x y$$

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = \delta x y - \gamma y$$

where \\(x\\) is the number of prey \\(y\\) is the number of some
predator \\(\tfrac {dy}{dt}\\) and \\(\tfrac {dx}{dt}\\) represent the
growth rates of the two populations over time; \\(t\\) represents
time; and α, β, γ, δ are positive real parameters describing the
interaction of the two species.

#What does that all mean?

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha x - \beta x y$$

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = \delta x y - \gamma y$$


* \\(x\\) is the number of &#x1F430;prey
* \\(y\\) is the number of &#x1F43A;predators
* α is related to &#x1F430;prey birth rate
* β is related to how often &#x1F43A;predators eat &#x1F430;prey
* γ is related to &#x1F43A;predator population growth
* δ is related to &#x1F43A;predator death rate
